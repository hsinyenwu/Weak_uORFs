This manuscript aims to identify the relationship between transcription start sites (TSSs) and uORF availability. Through systematically analyzing ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) data in Arabidopsis, we identified a group of ‘weak’ uORFs, which exhibit relatively low translation levels compared to their mORFs and do not associate with significant translational repression. Follow-up analysis revealed that these weak uORFs are often located upstream of the major transcription start sites (TSSs) or overlap with the TSS clusters. This positioning implies that only a small fraction of mRNAs contain the uORFs, preventing translational repression by uORFs (see model below). In contrast, strong uORFs are primarily located downstream of the TSSs. Consistent with this idea, uORFs that were predicted based on the annotation but not identified by Ribo-seq, are largely located upstream of TSSs. Our study revealed a pivotal role of transcription start sites in determining the translation and repressiveness of uORFs. Our results also provide a warning note of the necessity of examining the TSSs prior to functionally characterizing uORFs.

## uORF list:
The translated uORF list is from [Wu et al, 2023](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.08.556947.abstract). You can find the ORFs_max_filt_expressed file (i.e., RiboTaper output) [Here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/89j7snbm2r/2).

### TSS-seq and CAGE-seq data are download from [TAIR website](https://www.arabidopsis.org)  
We extracted TSS information from the JBrowse on the TAIR website (see below).  
[TSS-seq (two weeks old seedling) data from Nielsen et al., PLoS Genetics 2019](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007969)    
[CAGE-seq (two weeks old seedling) data from Thieffry et al., The Plant Cell 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7268790)   
The downloaded data were further processed into [RiboPlotR](https://github.com/hsinyenwu/RiboPlotR) tabular format with four columns: "total counts", "chromosome number", "P-site position" and "strand" (+ or -).   
The processed files and other files required for reproducing this research are uploaded to [Mendeley data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8g76gxgwk9/1).
